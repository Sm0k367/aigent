# 🧬 AIGENT — Sovereign AI Agent Interface v0.1

> **"I do not simulate. I do not try. I manifest."**

## 🔱 Overview
AIGent is a next-generation web interface for interacting with a coordinated system of AI agents. It features a cinematic 3D canvas (powered by React Three Fiber) alongside a chat interface, where specialized agents collaborate on tasks like code generation, design, visualization, and more.

This is an **MVP in active development** — the vision is a fully autonomous "agent army" conducting creation in an infinite digital horizon.

## ⚔️ Agent Army (Planned Architecture)
- 🎥 **Visionary Corps**: Generates and renders 3D scenes in the RealityCanvas.
- 🧠 **CodeSynth Engineers**: Handles code generation and execution.
- 🖌️ **DesignCore Elite**: Enforces visual theme and generates assets.
- 📖 **ScriptSmith Order**: Manages narratives and prompts.
- 🔐 **KeyMaster Ops**: Handles secrets and external APIs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **3D Engine**: Three.js / React Three Fiber + Drei
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with Epic Gold / Void Black theme)
- **Animations**: GSAP
- **AI**: Vercel AI SDK + LangChain (configurable for OpenAI, Grok, etc.)
- **Language**: TypeScript

## 🚀 Setup & Running Locally
1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sm0k367/aigent.git
   cd aigent

Install dependencies:bash

npm install

Set up environment variables:
Copy .env.example to .env.local and fill in your API keys (start with at least one LLM key, e.g., OPENAI_API_KEY for basic functionality).
Run the dev server:bash

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000

 Current Status & RoadmapCurrent: Basic Next.js setup with 3D-ready config. (Adding core UI and agent logic now.)
Next: Chat interface + streaming AI responses + dynamic 3D agent visualizations.
Future: Multi-agent coordination, voice I/O, image/video gen integration.
